  <strong>The design team</strong> is more than just making things look nice
  (but that is certainly part of it).
</p>
<p>
  We have our hands in every part of the game creation process, from menacing
  monster sketches to working out turn-based combat.
</p>
<p>
  If youâ€™re an imaginative writer, a Photoshop warrior, or a sketchbook Picasso,
  this is the team for you!
