  <h1>A Brief History</h1>
  <p>
    We're a new club at <a href="https://gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a> all about
    making our own board games! We're currently building our first ever game
    <i>Escape to Elysium.</i> Members of all interests are welcome. Between
    designing artwork, marketing, or just coming up with crazy ideas, you'll
    definitely find your place :)
