  <p>
    We're a new club at <a href="https://gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a> all about
    making our own board games! We're currently building our first ever game
    "Escape to Elysium." Members of all interests are welcome. Between designing
    artwork, marketing, or just coming up with crazy ideas, you'll definitely
    find your place :)
